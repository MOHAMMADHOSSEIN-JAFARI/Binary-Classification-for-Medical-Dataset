This research will do a binary classification task to generate a model which can determine the
people who will donate blood. The Dataset is based on the information of a health center in
Taiwana. The Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines are the Statistical Learning
Algorithms which are used to generate the appropriate models. The findings of the research show
the logistic Regression can have better performance in producing a model which can predict
whether a person will donate blood or not according to the features in this research
